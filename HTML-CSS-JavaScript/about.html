				<h3 class="colored">Technology</h3>
				<p class="indented">In school, I was the rare student whose favorite subject was math. I viewed it as a series of fun games and thus have always 
				been drawn to the puzzles within technology. I am very comfortable working with different software and grasping their functions
				quickly, as I have experienced a number of system migrations and been asked to train colleagues on new applications and procedures.
				I have also worked with several in-house database management systems on claims projects.</p>
			
				<h3 class="colored">Collaboration</h3>
				<p class="indented">Though my affinity for technological problems is a constant, the most valuable attribute I have gained from working in industries
				as disparate as entertainment, investments and claims, is my ability to not only interact with different personalities, but also aim
				to understand issues from their perspectives. It is a quality that has been very useful in maintaining strong relationships throughout
				my career and will no doubt remain a necessary advantage moving forward.</p>
				
				<h3 class="colored">Interests</h3>
				<p class="indented"> I enjoy watching movies and television, and love learning about different cultures.</p>
